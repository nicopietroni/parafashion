Libigl is developed most often on Mac OS X, though has current users in Linux
and Windows.

### Linux/Mac OS X/Cygwin ###

Libigl may also be compiled to a static library. This is advantageous when
building a project with libigl, since when used as an header-only library can
slow down compile times.

To build the entire libigl library producing at least `libigl/lib/libigl.a` and
possible other (automatically detected) extras, e.g. `libigl/lib/libiglcgal.a`
from _this current directory_: issue:

    mkdir -p ../lib
    cd ../lib
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../optional
    make

#### Warnings ####

You should expect to see a few linker warnings of the form:

    /opt/local/bin/ranlib: file: libigl.a(*.cpp.o) has no symbols

These are (admittedly unpopular) functions that have never been used by us
statically so we haven't explicit instantiations (yet).

#### External ####

Finally there are a number of external libraries that we include in
`./external/` because they are either difficult to obtain or they have been
patched for easier use with libigl. Please see the respective readmes in those
directories or build the tutorial using cmake, which will recursively build all
dependencies.

##### Installing Embree 2.0 #####
To build the embree library and executables on Mac OS X issue:

    cd external/embree
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    # Or using a different compiler
    #cmake .. -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/opt/local/bin/gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/opt/local/bin/g++
    make
    # Could also install embree to your root, but libigl examples don't expect
    # this
    #sudo make install

## Extras ##

## Explicit instantiations of templated functions

Special care must be taken by the developers of each function and
class in the libigl library that uses C++ templates. If this function
is intended to be compiled into the statically linked libigl library
then function is only compiled for each <i>explicitly</i> instantiated 
declaration. These should be added at the bottom of the corresponding
.cpp file surrounded by a

    #ifdef IGL_STATIC_LIBRARY

Of course, a developer may not know ahead of time which
instantiations should be explicitly included in the igl static lib.
One way to find out is to add one explicit instantiation for each
call in one's own project. This only ever needs to be done once for
each template.

The process is somewhat mechanical using a linker with reasonable error
output.

Supposed for example we have compiled the igl static lib, including the
cat.h and cat.cpp functions, without any explicit instantiation. Say
using the makefile in the `libigl` directory:

    cd $LIBIGL
    make

Now if we try to compile a project and link against it we may get
an error like:


    Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
    "Eigen::Matrix<int, -1, -1, 0, -1, -1> igl::cat<Eigen::Matrix<int, -1, -1, 0, -1, -1> >(int, Eigen::Matrix<int, -1, -1, 0, -1, -1> const&, Eigen::Matrix<int, -1, -1, 0, -1, -1> const&)", referenced from:
    uniform_sample(Eigen::Matrix<double, -1, -1, 0, -1, -1> const&, Eigen::Matrix<int, -1, -1, 0, -1, -1> const&, int, double, Eigen::Matrix<double, -1, -1, 0, -1, -1>&)in Skinning.o
    "Eigen::SparseMatrix<double, 0, int> igl::cat<Eigen::SparseMatrix<double, 0, int> >(int, Eigen::SparseMatrix<double, 0, int> const&, Eigen::SparseMatrix<double, 0, int> const&)", referenced from:
    covariance_scatter_matrix(Eigen::Matrix<double, -1, -1, 0, -1, -1> const&, Eigen::Matrix<int, -1, -1, 0, -1, -1> const&, ArapEnergy, Eigen::SparseMatrix<double, 0, int>&)in arap_dof.o
    arap_rhs(Eigen::Matrix<double, -1, -1, 0, -1, -1> const&, Eigen::Matrix<int, -1, -1, 0, -1, -1> const&, ArapEnergy, Eigen::SparseMatrix<double, 0, int>&)in arap_dof.o

This looks like a mess, but luckily we don't really need to read it
all. Just copy the first part in quotes

    Eigen::Matrix<int, -1, -1, 0, -1, -1> igl::cat<Eigen::Matrix<int, -1, -1, 0, -1, -1> >(int, Eigen::Matrix<int, -1, -1, 0, -1, -1> const&, Eigen::Matrix<int, -1, -1, 0, -1, -1> const&)

, then append it
to the list of explicit template instantiations at the end of
`cat.cpp` after the word
**template** and followed by a semi-colon.
Like this:

    #ifdef IGL_STATIC_LIBRARY
    // Explicit template instantiation
    template Eigen::Matrix<int, -1, -1, 0, -1, -1> igl::cat<Eigen::Matrix<int, -1, -1, 0, -1, -1> >(int, Eigen::Matrix<int, -1, -1, 0, -1, -1> const&, Eigen::Matrix<int, -1, -1, 0, -1, -1> const&);
    #endif

Then you must recompile the IGL static library.

    cd $LIBIGL
    make

And try to compile your project again, potentially repeating this
process until no more symbols are undefined.

`It may be useful to check that you code compiles with
no errors first using the headers-only version to be sure that all errors are from missing template
instantiations.`

If you're using make then the following command will
reveal each missing symbol on its own line:

    make 2>&1 | grep "referenced from" | sed -e "s/, referenced from.*//"

Alternatively you can use the `autoexplicit.sh` function
which (for well organized .h/.cpp pairs in libigl) automatically
create explicit instantiations from your compiler's error messages.
Repeat this process until convergence:

    cd /to/your/project
    make 2>$LIBIGL/make.err
    cd $LIBIGL
    cat make.err | ./autoexplicit.sh
    make clean
    make


### Benefits of static library

* **Faster compile time**: Because the libigl library
    is already compiled, only the new code in ones project must be
    compiled and then linked to IGL. This means compile times are
    generally faster.
* **Debug or optimized**: The IGL static
    library may be compiled in debug mode or optimized release mode
    regardless of whether one's project is being optimized or
    debugged.

### Drawbacks of static library

*  **Hard to use templates**: Special
    care</a> (by the developers of the library) needs to be taken when
    exposing templated functions.

# Compressed .h/.cpp pair
Calling the script:

    scripts/compress.sh igl.h igl.cpp

will create a single header `igl.h` and a single cpp file `igl.cpp`.

Alternatively, you can also compress everything into a single header file:

    scripts/compress.sh igl.h

### Benefits of compressed .h/.cpp pair

* **Easy incorporation**: This can be easily incorporated
  into external projects.

### Drawbacks of compressed .h/.cpp pair

* **Hard to debug/edit**: The compressed files are
  automatically generated. They're huge and should not be edited. Thus
  debugging and editting are near impossible.

* **Compounded dependencies**:
  An immediate disadvantage of this
  seems to be that even to use a single function (e.g.
  `cotmatrix`), compiling and linking against
  `igl.cpp` will require linking to all of `libigl`'s
  dependencies (`OpenGL`, `GLUT`,
  `AntTweakBar`, `BLAS`). However, because all
  depencies other than Eigen should be encapsulated between
  `#ifndef` guards (e.g. `#ifndef IGL_NO_OPENGL`, it
  is possible to ignore certain functions that have such dependencies.

* **Long compile**: 
  Compiling `igl.cpp` takes a long time and isn't easily parallelized (no `make
  -j12` equivalent).

Here's a tiny test example using `igl.h` and `igl.cpp`. Save the following in `test.cpp`:

    #include <igl.h>
    #include <Eigen/Core>

    int main(int argc, char * argv[])
    {
    Eigen::MatrixXd V;
    Eigen::MatrixXi F;
    return (argc>=2 && igl::read_triangle_mesh(argv[1],V,F)?0:1);
    }

Then compile `igl.cpp` with:

    g++ -o igl.o -c igl.cpp -I/opt/local/include/eigen3 -DIGL_NO_OPENGL -DIGL_NO_ANTTWEAKBAR

Notice that we're using `-DIGL_NO_OPENGL -DIGL_NO_ANTTWEAKBAR` to disable any libigl dependencies on OpenGL and AntTweakBar.

Now compile `test.cpp` with:

    g++ -g -I/opt/local/include/eigen3/ -I/usr/local/igl/libigl/ -L/usr/local/igl/libigl/ -ligl -DIGL_NO_OPENGL -DIGL_NO_ANTTWEAKBAR -o test

Try running it with:

    ./test path/to/mesh.obj


The following bash one-liner will find all source files that contain the string `OpenGL` but don't contain and `IGL_NO_OPENGL` guard:

    grep OpenGL `grep -L IGL_NO_OPENGL include/igl/*`

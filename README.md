*Private* repository for our UTSxETHZ project. See [our google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YJcQI7zYRa3qaVeT9jVHU1yS_E3X_eKo?usp=sharing).

## BUILD

See `BUILD.md`.

## TODOES

### Must-do

* myglwidget: split, put key/mouse bindings in another file
* repair double click path removal 
* split window between 3D and 2D
* Submodule field_tracing, which Nico will upgrade later
* Link to Directional (+ recent libigl) instead of old libigl
* Submodules for AntTweakBar
* investigate error in console: "ERROR(AntTweakBar) >> Invalid parameter"
* reduce compiling time (reorder functions, smaller myglwidget)
* viz: 3-singularities and selected paths are both red, change that

### Might-do

* also allow qmake ?
* Add I/O to AntTweakBar menu ?
* replace glut with glfw ?
* `include` folder for `field_tracing`

## Contributing

Different people have different ways but here's mine:

* create your own branch, do your stuff
* when ready, rebase on master
* pull request, wait for one reviewer

If you'd rather do things another way let's discuss this on Slack.

*Private* repository for our UTSxETHZ project. See [our google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YJcQI7zYRa3qaVeT9jVHU1yS_E3X_eKo?usp=sharing).

## TODOES

### Must-do

* vcg submodule
* Get it to run on our machines
* Use external tracing library, which Nico will upgrade later
* Link to Directional (+ recent libigl) instead of old libigl

### Might-do

* Add I/O to AntTweakBar menu ?
* Replace AntTweakBar with Dear ImGui (which is already bundled with libigl) ?

## Contributing

Different people have different ways but here's mine:

* create your own branch, do your stuff
* when ready, rebase on master
* pull request, wait for one reviewer

If you'd rather do things another way let's discuss this on Slack.
